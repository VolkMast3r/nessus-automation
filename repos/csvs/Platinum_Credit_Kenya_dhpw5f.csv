methods are allowed on each directory.

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,
403, 405, or 501.

necessarily indicate the presence of any security vulnerabilities.","n/a","http://www.nessus.org/u?d9c03a9a

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

vulnerabilities.","The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header
or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all
content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a
clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a
user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different
than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user
performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.

X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate
clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser
vendors.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among
all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other
attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which
sources can embed the protected resource.

Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy
response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they
are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through
automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if
other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are
deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive
transactions.","Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the
'frame-ancestors' directive) HTTP header with the page's response.

using a weak hashing algorithm.","The remote service uses a known CA certificate in the SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a 
cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be 
vulnerable to collision attacks (CVE-2004-2761, for example). An attacker can exploit this to generate another 
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as 
vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable 
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on any
certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.

Known certificate authority root certificates are inherently trusted and so any potential issues with the signature, 
including it being signed using a weak hashing algorithm, are not considered security issues.","Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.","http://www.nessus.org/u?ae636e78

  - Possible request smuggling in mod_proxy_ajp: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request
    Smuggling') vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to
    the AJP server it forwards requests to.  This issue affects Apache HTTP Server Apache HTTP Server 2.4
    version 2.4.53 and prior versions. Acknowledgements: Ricter Z @ 360 Noah Lab (CVE-2022-26377)

  - Read beyond bounds in mod_isapi: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier on Windows may read beyond bounds
    when configured to process requests with the mod_isapi module.  Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server
    project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28330)

  - Read beyond bounds via ap_rwrite(): The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may
    read unintended memory if an attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite()
    or ap_rputs(), such as with mod_luas r:puts() function. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project
    would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28614)

  - Read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match(): Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose
    information due to a read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input
    buffer.  While no code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or
    lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP
    Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28615)

  - Denial of service in mod_lua r:parsebody: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, a malicious request to a
    lua script that calls r:parsebody(0) may cause a denial of service due to no default limit on possible
    input size. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop
    LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-29404)

  - Denial of Service mod_sed: If Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 is configured to do transformations with mod_sed in
    contexts where the input to mod_sed may be very large, mod_sed may make excessively large memory
    allocations and trigger an abort. Acknowledgements: This issue was found by Brian Moussalli from the JFrog
    Security Research team (CVE-2022-30522)

  - Information Disclosure in mod_lua with websockets: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may return lengths
    to applications calling r:wsread() that point past the end of the storage allocated for the buffer.
    Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for
    reporting this issue (CVE-2022-30556)

  - X-Forwarded-For dropped by hop-by-hop mechanism in mod_proxy: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may not
    send the X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin server based on client side Connection header hop-by-hop
    mechanism. This may be used to bypass IP based authentication on the origin server/application.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be 
vulnerable to collision attacks (CVE-2004-2761, for example). An attacker can exploit this to generate another 
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as 
vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable 
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on any
certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.

Known certificate authority root certificates are inherently trusted and so any potential issues with the signature, 
including it being signed using a weak hashing algorithm, are not considered security issues.","Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.","http://www.nessus.org/u?ae636e78

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

vulnerabilities.","The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header
or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all
content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a
clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a
user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different
than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user
performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.

X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate
clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser
vendors.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among
all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other
attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which
sources can embed the protected resource.

Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy
response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they
are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through
automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if
other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are
deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive
transactions.","Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,
403, 405, or 501.

vulnerabilities.","The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header
or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all
content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a
clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a
user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different
than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user
performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.

X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate
clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser
vendors.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among
all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other
attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which
sources can embed the protected resource.

Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy
response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they
are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through
automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if
other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are
deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

"95631","","","None","carloan.momentumcredit.co.ke","tcp","2096","SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm (Known CA)","A known CA SSL certificate in the certificate chain has been signed
using a weak hashing algorithm.","The remote service uses a known CA certificate in the SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a 
cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be 
vulnerable to collision attacks (CVE-2004-2761, for example). An attacker can exploit this to generate another 
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as 
vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable 
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on any
certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.

Known certificate authority root certificates are inherently trusted and so any potential issues with the signature, 
including it being signed using a weak hashing algorithm, are not considered security issues.","Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.","http://www.nessus.org/u?ae636e78

cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be 
vulnerable to collision attacks (CVE-2004-2761, for example). An attacker can exploit this to generate another 
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as 
vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable 
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on any
certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

using a weak hashing algorithm.","The remote service uses a known CA certificate in the SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a 
cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be 
vulnerable to collision attacks (CVE-2004-2761, for example). An attacker can exploit this to generate another 
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as 
vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable 
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on any
certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.

Known certificate authority root certificates are inherently trusted and so any potential issues with the signature, 
including it being signed using a weak hashing algorithm, are not considered security issues.","Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.","http://www.nessus.org/u?ae636e78
